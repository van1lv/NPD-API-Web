# NPD-API-Web

NPDSERVER.war is the final version of the project.

The resources in the file are organized according Maven. You could use command 'mvn package' to generate war file. 

I used tomcat as web server in this project. You can just put the war file generated from the code into webapps within the Tomcat and start the server. It is very convenient.
